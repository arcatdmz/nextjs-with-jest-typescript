## code

- `package.json/jest`: use `ts-jest` to test TypeScript files; use mocks for imported CSS/LESS files; use TypeScript compiler to handle both TS/JS files
- `jest.setup.ts`: use `enzyme` to test with [jQuery-like APIs](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme#readme)
- `tsconfig.jest.json`: handles JSX transformation by `ts-jest` during the test
